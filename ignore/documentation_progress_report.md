# SAGE Documentation Expansion Progress Report

## Summary of Progress

We have successfully completed the documentation expansion project for all files in the SAGE codebase. The focus has been on adding `@file` documentation headers to files that were missing them, and ensuring all significant functions have proper `@brief` documentation.

## Files Completed

| File | Changes Made | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| model_cooling_heating.c | Added `@file` documentation header | Complete |
| model_mergers.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for `estimate_merging_time()` | Complete |
| model_starformation_and_feedback.c | Added `@file` documentation header | Complete |
| model_misc.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for all functions | Complete |
| core_build_model.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for all functions | Complete |
| core_save.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for all functions | Complete |
| core_io_tree.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for all functions | Complete |
| core_cool_func.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for all functions | Complete |
| core_init.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for all functions | Complete |
| core_read_parameter_file.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for `read_parameter_file()` | Complete |

| io/io_save_hdf5.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for key functions | Complete |
| parameter_table.c | Added `@file` documentation header and `@brief` for all functions | Complete |
| main.c | Already well documented | Complete |
| core_mymalloc.c | Already well documented | Complete |
| model_disk_instability.c | Already well documented | Complete |
| model_infall.c | Already well documented | Complete |
| model_reincorporation.c | Already well documented | Complete |

## Documentation Quality

The documentation added follows the established standards in `doc_standards.md` and is consistent with the well-documented examples in the codebase. Each file header includes:

1. A brief description of the file's contents
2. A detailed explanation of the file's purpose and functionality
3. A list of key functions with brief descriptions
4. Relevant scientific references

Function documentation includes:

1. A brief description of what the function does
2. Parameter descriptions with their meaning
3. Return value descriptions where applicable
4. Detailed explanations of algorithms and scientific context
5. References to scientific papers where relevant

## Recommendations for Future Work

While the documentation expansion project is now complete, here are some recommendations for maintaining and improving the code documentation in the future:

1. **Update documentation when modifying code**: Ensure that any future code changes are accompanied by corresponding documentation updates.

2. **Maintain consistency**: Continue to follow the established documentation standards for new files and functions.

3. **Regular documentation reviews**: Periodically review documentation to identify areas that may need updates or improvements, especially as the scientific models evolve.

4. **Add more detailed scientific background**: Consider expanding the scientific context in key model files, potentially linking to relevant papers or equations.

5. **Improve cross-referencing**: Add more references between related functions in different files to help developers understand the code flow better.

The improved documentation should make the SAGE codebase more maintainable, easier to understand for new developers, and will facilitate future enhancements and refactoring efforts.
