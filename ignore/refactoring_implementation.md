# SAGE Codebase Refactoring Implementation Report

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of refactoring recommendations for the SAGE (Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution) codebase. The refactoring aims to improve code organization, reduce global variable usage, enhance maintainability, and ensure proper encapsulation of data.

## Implemented Recommendations

### Phase 1.1: Header Organization (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Split monolithic `core_allvars.h` into focused headers
  - `constants.h`: Physical and numerical constants
  - `types.h`: Type definitions and structures
  - `globals.h`: Global variable declarations
  - `config.h`: Configuration settings and macros
- ✅ Added proper header guards
- ✅ Updated include statements throughout the codebase

### Phase 1.2: Reducing Global Variable Usage (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `SageConfig` structure for configuration parameters
- ✅ Created `SimulationState` structure for runtime state
- ✅ Updated parameter file reading to populate structures
- ✅ Added synchronization with global variables for backward compatibility
- ✅ Fixed memory management issues in the LIFO allocation system

### Phase 2.1: Accessor Functions (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Created accessor header `accessors.h` with comprehensive getter/setter functions
- ✅ Implemented accessor functions in `accessors.c`
- ✅ Added accessor files to Makefile
- ✅ Updated `model_infall.c` to use accessors instead of direct globals
- ⬜ Update remaining files to use accessor functions

### Phase 2.2: Physical Constants as Defined Constants (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Enhanced `constants.h` with comprehensive documented constants
- ✅ Added missing constants from physics calculations
- ✅ Organized constants into logical groupings with comments
- ✅ Updated code to use constants from `constants.h`

### Phase 2.3: Function-Specific Globals as Static Variables (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Converted memory tracking variables in `core_mymalloc.c` to static
- ✅ Converted cooling table variables in `core_cool_func.c` to static
- ✅ Made `get_rate()` helper function static in `core_cool_func.c`
- ⬜ Identify and convert remaining function-specific globals

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Phase 2.1: Accessor Functions**
   - Update remaining physics modules to use accessor functions
   - Update I/O and initialization code to use accessors
   - Add validation in accessor functions where appropriate

2. **Complete Phase 2.3: Function-Specific Globals**
   - Review remaining source files for function-specific globals
   - Convert identified globals to static variables
   - Update any function prototypes where needed

3. **Progress on Phase 3.1: Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling system with multiple severity levels
   - Successfully refactored the core components of the codebase:
     - Parameter reading (`core_read_parameter_file.c`)
     - File I/O operations (`core_io_tree.c`, `core_save.c`)
     - Initialization routines (`core_init.c`)
     - Binary and HDF5 file handling (`tree_binary.c`, `tree_hdf5.c`)
   - Created error_handling_guidelines.md with clear documentation on when to use each severity level
   - Created tracking document to monitor refactoring progress
   - Error handling now includes context (file, line, function) for better debugging
   - Remaining work will focus on physics modules

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Compile and test each module after changes
   - Run test simulations to ensure results match original code
   - Verify memory usage and performance impact

## Implementation Notes

### Accessor Functions
The accessor functions provide a clean interface to access global state and configuration, with several benefits:
- They encapsulate data access and can include validation
- They maintain backward compatibility by updating both new structures and old globals
- They improve code readability by making data dependencies explicit
- They facilitate future changes to the underlying data structures

### Physical Constants
The enhanced `constants.h` now contains all physical and numerical constants used in the code, properly documented and organized. This ensures consistency and makes the code more maintainable.

### Static Variables
Converting function-specific globals to static variables improves encapsulation and reduces the global namespace pollution. The changes have been made carefully to maintain functionality while reducing scope.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Backward Compatibility
To maintain backward compatibility, we've used a dual-update approach where both the new structures and old globals are updated. This allows for gradual transition to the new accessor-based approach.

### Code Organization
The split of monolithic headers required careful tracking of dependencies. We've organized headers with clear include hierarchies to avoid circular dependencies.

### Large Global Arrays
Some globals like the galaxy arrays are still global due to their size and complex interactions across many functions. These will require more extensive refactoring in future phases.
