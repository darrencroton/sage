2025-09-20: [Phase 1.2] Directory Reorganization Complete
- Successfully reorganized monolithic code/ structure into modern src/core, src/physics, src/io, src/utils directories using git mv
- Updated all include paths, CMakeLists.txt, and plotting system path resolution for new structure  
- Validated build system, scientific accuracy (identical results), and plotting functionality
- Created comprehensive docs/directory-structure.md and updated all documentation
- **Files Moved**: All 40+ source files relocated preserving git history
- **Files Modified**: CMakeLists.txt, sage-plot.py, README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/quick-reference.md, log/phase.md, log/architecture.md
- **Files Created**: docs/directory-structure.md, tests/ directory

2025-09-22: [Phase 1.3] Memory Management Centralization Complete
- Successfully centralized all memory allocations through existing util_memory.c (now memory.c) system with comprehensive tracking
- Implemented missing mycalloc functions, created centralized src/core/memory.h header, replaced all malloc/calloc/realloc/free calls
- Applied appropriate memory categories (MEM_IO, MEM_UTILITY) and validated with Address Sanitizer testing
- Verified no memory leaks, proper tracking, and scientific accuracy maintained
- **Files Modified**: src/utils/util_memory.h (now memory.h), src/utils/util_memory.c (now memory.c), src/core/core_proto.h (now proto.h), src/core/main.c, src/io/io_tree.c (now tree.c), src/io/io_tree_hdf5.c (now tree_hdf5.c), src/io/io_save_binary.c (now save_binary.c), src/io/io_util.c (now util.c), src/utils/util_integration.c (now integration.c), CLAUDE.md, log/phase.md
- **Files Created**: src/core/memory.h

2025-09-22: [Phase 1.2 - update] File Naming Convention Modernization Complete
- Successfully removed legacy functional prefixes (core_, io_, util_, model_) from all 39 source files using git mv
- Updated 45+ #include statements, CMakeLists.txt, and all documentation to new naming convention
- Leverages modular directory structure - prefixes redundant when location provides context
- Validated clean compilation, scientific accuracy, and comprehensive testing
- **Files Renamed**: 39 files (8 core/, 7 physics/, 12 io/, 12 utils/) preserving git history
- **Files Modified**: CMakeLists.txt, 31 source files, README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/directory-structure.md, log/architecture.md
- **Files Archived**: core_allvars.h → scrap/core_allvars.h

2025-09-22: [Phase 1.4] Configuration Abstraction Layer Complete
- Successfully implemented modern YAML-based configuration system completely replacing legacy .par files with no backward compatibility
- Created comprehensive YAML parser with array support, config_reader with validation, and enhanced parameter processing
- Added output_snapshots array parsing, num_outputs validation (≤ last_snapshot+1), and professional error handling throughout
- Verified YAML configuration loads correctly, parses all parameters including arrays, and maintains scientific accuracy
- **Files Modified**: CMakeLists.txt, src/utils/config_reader.h/c, src/utils/yaml_parser.h/c, src/core/parameters.c, README.md, input/millennium.yaml
- **Files Created**: src/utils/yaml_parser.h/c, src/utils/config_reader.h/c, docs/yaml-configuration-guide.md
