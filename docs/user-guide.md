## Development Schedule

**Current Phase**: Infrastructure Foundation (Phase 1)
**Target Completion**: Validation & Polish (Phase 6)
**Development Approach**: Iterative, user-focused improvements

This guide will be developed progressively:

- **Phase 1-2**: Foundation structure and basic usage
- **Phase 3-4**: Advanced configuration and module system
- **Phase 5**: I/O system and data handling
- **Phase 6**: Final polish, comprehensive examples, and validation

## Current User Resources

While this comprehensive guide is under development, users can refer to:

- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Installation, quick start, and basic usage
- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Development and advanced usage guide
- **[YAML Configuration Guide](yaml-configuration-guide.md)** - Parameter file documentation
- **[Testing Guide](testing-guide.md)** - Validation and testing procedures

## Feedback and Contributions

User feedback is essential for creating a useful guide. Please contribute:

- **Usage questions** that should be addressed in documentation
- **Common workflows** that would benefit from detailed examples
- **Error scenarios** that need troubleshooting guidance
- **Scientific applications** that demonstrate SAGE capabilities

For immediate support, refer to the [project documentation index](quick-reference.md) and contact information in [README.md](../README.md).

## Scientific Context

SAGE is designed for researchers studying galaxy formation and evolution in cosmological simulations. The user guide will emphasize:

- **Scientific accuracy** and validation procedures
