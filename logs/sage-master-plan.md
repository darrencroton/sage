## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE

This implementation plan has been restructured to strictly adhere to the **8 Core Architectural Principles** defined in `log/sage-architecture-vision.md`. Each phase explicitly states which principles it addresses and ensures no violations occur.

### üéØ Core Architectural Principles
1. **Physics-Agnostic Core Infrastructure** - Core has zero physics knowledge
2. **Runtime Modularity** - Module combinations configurable without recompilation  
3. **Metadata-Driven Architecture** - Structure defined by metadata, not hardcoded
4. **Single Source of Truth** - One authoritative data representation
5. **Unified Processing Model** - Consistent merger tree processing
6. **Memory Efficiency and Safety** - Bounded, predictable memory usage
7. **Format-Agnostic I/O** - Multiple formats through unified interfaces
8. **Type Safety and Validation** - Type-safe access with automatic validation

---

## Executive Summary

This Master Implementation Plan guides the transformation of the `sage` codebase into a modern, modular architecture with a **physics-agnostic core and runtime-configurable physics modules**, while strictly maintaining architectural principle compliance throughout development.

### Key Transformation Goals
1. **Physics-Agnostic Core** (Principle 1): Core infrastructure with zero physics knowledge
2. **Type-Safe Property System** (Principles 3,4,8): Metadata-driven, compile-time validated access
3. **Runtime Module System** (Principle 2): Physics modules loaded/configured at runtime
4. **Unified I/O Architecture** (Principle 7): Format-agnostic with property-based output

### Implementation Approach
- **Architecture-First**: Establish foundational principles before building complexity
- **Scientific Preservation**: Every phase validates against reference results
- **Principle Compliance**: No architectural violations tolerated during development
- **Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers working, compliant functionality

## Phase 1: Infrastructure and Modernization Foundation

### Architectural Principles Addressed
- This phase prepares the ground for all 8 principles by establishing a modern build environment and creating crucial abstraction layers. It directly contributes to **Principle 6 (Memory Safety)** and **Principle 7 (Format-Agnostic I/O)** by creating the necessary interfaces.

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Replace the legacy Makefile with a modern CMake build system.
- **Secondary**: Reorganize the codebase into a logical directory structure that anticipates the core/physics split.
- **Critical**: Create abstraction layers for Memory, Configuration, and I/O to decouple core logic from specific implementations, enabling a smooth, incremental refactoring in later phases.

### Entry Criteria
- `sage` codebase selected as the starting point.
- Development environment (C compiler, Git, Python for scripting) is set up.

### Tasks

#### Task 1.1: CMake Build System Setup
- **Objective**: Replace the existing Makefile with a modern CMake configuration.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a root `CMakeLists.txt` with project configuration (e.g., `project(SAGE)`).
  - Set up source file discovery and define compilation flags (e.g., `-Wall`, `-g`).
  - Configure detection for optional dependencies like HDF5 and MPI using `find_package`.
  - Enable out-of-tree builds to keep the source directory clean.
- **Testing**: The CMake build produces a binary that is scientifically identical to the one produced by the Makefile.
- **Documentation**: Update `README.md` with clear, step-by-step instructions for configuring and building the project with CMake.
- **Effort**: 2 sessions (moderate complexity)

#### Task 1.2: Directory Reorganization
- **Objective**: Implement a modern project structure to prepare for modularization.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create the `src/core`, `src/core/auxdata`, `src/physics`, `src/io`, `src/scripts`, and `src/utils` directories.
  - Use `git mv` to move source files into the appropriate subdirectories.
    - **core**: `core_*.c`, `main.c`, `globals.h`, `types.h`, etc.
    - **auxdata**: move `extra/CoolFunctions` here.
    - **physics**: `model_*.c` files.
    - **io**: `io_*.c` files.
    - **utils**: `util_*.c` files.
  - Create `docs/` for documentation and `tests/` for future tests.
- **Testing**: The project builds successfully with the new directory structure. All `#include` paths are updated and correct.
- **Documentation**: Create a `docs/directory-structure.md` file explaining the layout.
- **Effort**: 1 session (low complexity)

#### Task 1.3: Memory Management Centralization
- **Objective**: Centralize all memory allocations through the existing `util_memory.c` system to prepare for module-aware tracking.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a new header `src/core/memory.h` that includes `util_memory.h`.
  - Perform a codebase-wide replacement of `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` with the corresponding functions from `util_memory.c` (`mymalloc`, `myrealloc`, `myfree`). Ensure `mycalloc` is implemented if needed.
  - All memory allocations must go through this centralized system.
- **Testing**: The code compiles and runs with no new memory errors. Valgrind reports no leaks, and the memory tracking system functions as before.
- **Effort**: 1 session (low complexity)

#### Task 1.4: Configuration Abstraction Layer
- **Objective**: Create unified config reading interface.
- **Implementation**:
  - Design `config_t` structure for unified access.
  - Create `config_reader.c` with JSON support (using a library like `cJSON`).
  - Add legacy `.par` file reading to the same interface, populating the `config_t` struct.
  - Implement a configuration validation framework.
- **Testing**: Both JSON and `.par` files can be read correctly into the `config_t` struct.
- **Documentation**: Configuration format specification.
- **Risk**: JSON library selection - use a proven, simple solution.
- **Effort**: 2 sessions (moderate complexity)

#### Task 1.5: I/O Abstraction Layer
- **Objective**: Create an abstraction layer for tree input and galaxy output to prepare for a unified, format-agnostic I/O system.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a new `io_manager.h` header.
  - Define a generic `io_manager_t` struct containing function pointers for key I/O operations (e.g., `load_tree_table`, `load_tree`, `save_galaxies`, `finalize_galaxy_files`).
  - In `main.c`, create an `io_manager_t` instance and initialize its function pointers to point to the existing functions in `io_tree.c` and `io_save_binary.c`/`io_save_hdf5.c`.
  - Replace direct calls to these I/O functions in the main loop with calls through the `io_manager_t` function pointers.
- **Testing**: The code compiles and runs, producing identical output files. Both binary and HDF5 I/O function correctly through the abstraction layer.
- **Effort**: 2 sessions (moderate complexity)

#### Task 1.6: Development and Documentation Infrastructure
- **Objective**: Establish the foundational documentation structure for the project.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create the `docs/` directory.
  - Create `docs/physics-module-guide.md` as a placeholder for the guide that will be written in Phase 2A.
