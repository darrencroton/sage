# SAGE Refactoring Summary

## New Files Created

- `code/accessors.h`: Accessor function declarations for controlled access to state
- `code/accessors.c`: Implementation of accessor functions
- `code/constants.h`: Physical and numerical constants
- `code/types.h`: Type definitions and structures
- `code/globals.h`: Global variable declarations
- `code/config.h`: Configuration settings and macros
- `code/core_simulation_state.c`: Implementation of SimulationState functions

## Files Modified

- `code/model_infall.c`: Updated to use accessor functions
- `code/core_cool_func.c`: Converted globals to static variables 
- `code/core_proto.h`: Updated function prototypes
- `Makefile`: Added new files to the build system

## Documentation Created

- `refactoring_implementation.md`: Tracks implementation progress
- `refactoring_plan.md`: Overall refactoring strategy and plan

## Current Status

- Phase 1 (Header Organization and Basic Structure): **COMPLETED**
- Phase 2.1 (Accessor Functions): **IN PROGRESS** (~30% complete)
- Phase 2.2 (Physical Constants): **COMPLETED**
- Phase 2.3 (Function-Specific Globals): **IN PROGRESS** (~40% complete)

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating physics modules to use accessor functions
2. Review remaining source files for function-specific globals
3. Convert identified globals to static variables
4. Test the code with example simulations to verify results

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns with focused header files
2. **Reduced Global Variable Exposure**: Encapsulation of state in structures
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of constants and structure members
4. **Better Memory Management**: Fixed issues in LIFO allocation system
5. **Better Maintainability**: Code now follows more modern C practices
