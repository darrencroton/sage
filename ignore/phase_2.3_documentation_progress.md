# Phase 2.3: Documentation Improvements - Progress Report

## Completed Work

### 1. Function Documentation
- Added comprehensive function header documentation to key files:
  - `main.c`: Main program entry point and execution flow
  - `core_build_model.c`: Core galaxy construction and evolution functions
  - `model_starformation_and_feedback.c`: Star formation and feedback processes
  - `model_cooling_heating.c`: Gas cooling and AGN heating processes
  - `model_infall.c`: Gas infall and stripping processes, including:
    - `infall_recipe()`: Gas accretion onto halos
    - `strip_from_satellite()`: Environmental stripping of satellite gas 
    - `do_reionization()`: Suppression of gas infall due to reionization
  - `model_mergers.c`: Galaxy merger processes, including:
    - `collisional_starburst_recipe()`: Star formation during mergers

### 2. Algorithm Documentation
- Enhanced inline comments for complex calculations:
  - Gas cooling algorithm including cooling radius calculation
  - AGN feedback with different accretion models
  - Star formation with disk dynamical time calculations
  - Supernova feedback with mass and energy conservation
  - Reionization effects on gas accretion with appropriate scale factor regimes
  - Merger-induced starbursts with mass ratio dependencies
  - Environmental stripping of satellite galaxies

### 3. High-Level Documentation
- Created `/code/README.md` with comprehensive overview of:
  - Directory structure
  - Major components
  - Execution flow
  - Key algorithms
  - Customization options
- Created `/documentation/phase_2.3_summary.md` with detailed documentation of all improvements

### 4. Documentation Standards
- Created `/code/doc_standards.md` defining:
  - Function documentation template
  - File documentation template
  - Inline comment standards
  - Variable naming and documentation guidelines
  - Documentation maintenance practices

## Benefits of Documentation Improvements

1. **Improved Readability**: New developers can more easily understand the code's purpose and functionality
2. **Better Maintainability**: Clear explanations of complex algorithms make future modifications easier
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Scientific context and implementation details are now explicitly documented
4. **Scientific Transparency**: Physical models and assumptions are clearly stated with references
5. **Easier Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the codebase structure

## Completed Documentation Objectives

All functions identified for documentation in Phase 2.3 have been completed:

1. ✅ Added consistent function header comments
2. ✅ Documented complex algorithms with clear explanations
3. ✅ Created high-level documentation explaining code structure
4. ✅ Added inline comments for complex calculations

## Next Steps

Moving to Phase 3.1: Memory Management Optimization

1. **Relax LIFO Restriction**
   - Implement a more flexible memory management system
   - Use reference counting or another tracking approach
   - Update `myfree()` and `myrealloc()` to support this
   - Maintain backward compatibility for existing code

2. **Improve Array Allocation Strategy**
   - Replace fixed increment strategy with growth factor approach
   - Update galaxy array allocation in `core_build_model.c`
   - Implement dynamic sizing for fixed arrays where appropriate
   - Add memory usage optimization for large simulations
